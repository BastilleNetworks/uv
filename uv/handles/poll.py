    """
    Poll handles are used to watch file descriptors for readability and
    writability. The purpose of poll handles is to enable integrating
    external libraries that rely on the event loop to signal them about
    the socket status changes. Using them for any other purpose is not
    recommended. Use :class:`uv.TCP`, :class:`uv.UDP`, etc. instead,
    which provide faster and more scalable implementations, than what
    can be archived with :class:`uv.Poll`, especially on Windows.

    It is possible that poll handles occasionally signal that a file
    descriptor is readable or writable even when it is not. The user
    should therefore always be prepared to handle `EAGAIN` or equivalent
    when it attempts to read from or write to the fd.

    It is not okay to have multiple active poll handles for the same
    socket, this can cause libuv to busyloop or otherwise malfunction.

    Do not close a file descriptor while it is being polled by an active
    poll handle. This can cause the handle to report an error, but it
    might also start polling another socket. However the fd can be
    safely closed immediately after :func:`uv.Poll.stop` or
    :func:`uv.Handle.close` has been called.

    .. note::

        On Windows only sockets can be polled with :class:`uv.Poll`
        handles. On Unix any file descriptor that would be accepted
        by :manpage:`poll(2)` can be used.
